# qwen36: CUDA VRAM expert tier

Applies colibri's placement concept ("route -> place -> overlap -> learn") to
Qwen3.6-35B-A3B one level up from the GLM disk tier: all 10,240 experts live
in RAM, the **hot** ones are promoted into DEVICE_LOCAL VRAM across one or
more GPUs and computed there through the existing shared CUDA backend
(`backend_cuda.cu` expert-group API — no new backend).

## How it works

- **Home device:** expert `eid` lives on GPU `eid % n_gpus`; no duplicates.
- **Placement:** routing heat decides who earns VRAM (LFRU semantics from
  `tier.h`, 25%+4 hysteresis). A parallel **warmstart** fills the per-device
  budget before the first token — ordered by a persisted heat table
  (`HEAT_FILE`) when present, so a second run starts fully placed.
- **Decode:** per (token, layer) the resident experts are issued as async
  groups on all devices (`coli_cuda_expert_group_issue/take`); VRAM misses
  fall back to the CPU int8 path and overlap with the in-flight groups, as
  does the shared expert. Placement never changes routing or precision.
- **Memory:** the warmstart frees the RAM int8 copies of VRAM-resident
  experts (rematerialized from the packed int4 copy on LFRU eviction; no
  container access). Peak RSS for the 35B int4 container: ~29 GB with two
  8 GB GPUs.

## Usage

```bash
make -C c qwen36 CUDA=1 CUDA_ARCH=native   # NVCC=/usr/bin/nvcc on distro CUDA
COLI_CUDA=1 COLI_GPUS=0,1 HEAT_FILE=heat.bin CUDA_EXPERT_GB=auto \
OMP_NUM_THREADS=<physical cores> OMP_WAIT_POLICY=ACTIVE OMP_PROC_BIND=close \
SNAP=<container> N_NEW=200 ./c/qwen36 256 4 prompt.txt
```

`cap` (argv[1]) must equal `n_experts` (full RAM residency). int4 containers
only (the int8 container keeps the CPU path). `COLI_TIMERS=1` prints
per-phase timings and tier telemetry.

## Measured (Threadripper 3945WX 12C, RTX 3070 8 GB + Quadro RTX 4000 8 GB, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B int4, 200-token decode)

| | 1 GPU (8 GB) | 2 GPUs (16 GB) |
|---|---|---|
| decode tok/s (cold / warm heat) | 9.2 / 9.9 | 10.6 / **11.3** |
| VRAM-resident experts | 4,391 (43 %) | 8,532 (83 %) |
| VRAM hit rate (cold / warm) | 44 % / 95 % | 85 % / 100 % |
| peak RSS | 40 GB | **29 GB** |
| reference: Ollama q4_K_M, same box | 7.5 | 10.5 |

CPU-only baseline of this engine before the tier: 0.35 tok/s.
Numerics: logits cosine vs the f32 CPU reference 0.9992 (dense int8 on),
bit-identical GPU-vs-CPU on the same container (cosine 1.0000001).
